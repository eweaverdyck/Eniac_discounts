# Discounts at Eniac
This project was carried out as part of the the WBS Coding School Data Science Bootcamp.

Teams were given a real-world (anonymized) business database and asked to assess whether discounts were beneficial or not.

The database had major quality issues, so a large part of the project was devoted to data cleaning.

After data cleaning and the calculation of summary statistics, we analyzed the relationship between discounts and revenue both over time and across product categories. Our analysis revealed that discounts had no discernible positive impact on revenue, with the possible exception of low-priced accessories.

In addition to data cleaning and analysis, a major focus of the project was on plotting with the Seaborn library.

We delivered a five-minute presentation on our findings supported by a slideshow.
